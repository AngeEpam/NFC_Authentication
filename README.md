# NFC_Authentication
Authenticating users using NFC

With this NFC authenticator, even if someone scans your card and then emulates the key, they won't be able to access your system or application unless their scanned NFC tag ID matches one of the pre-defined authorized tag IDs in the system.

This was tested using an NFC reader and it was perfectly fine. 

Requirements to run the code:
In terms of software:
Python 3 
nfcpy library
Flask library
In terms of hardware:
NFC reader
